# Getting Started

Welcome to the documentation for the Restoration Dashboard!

## API Environments

There are two separate API environments: **staging** and **production**.

It is recommended to get started with the **staging** environment to ensure proper API connectivity before integrating with the **production** environment.

REST API Base URL's:
- **staging**: https://staging-api-xlxcoeos5q-uc.a.run.app
- **production**: https://api.restorationdashboard.com

## Next Steps

This API uses the Oauth2.0 Client Credentials authorization flow to authenticate to the REST HTTP API. Start with the [authentication](./guides/authentication) guide to get connected, and check out the [API Reference](./api-reference) for specific data endpoints.
